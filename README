=head1 NAME

Para::Frame::Template::Plugin::Meta::Interpolate - Allow evaluation of META parameters

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  [% META next_template = '~$home/' %]

Goes to the site home page next

  [% META title='-"404 - " _ loc("File not found")' %]

The value is enclosed in C<''>. The initial C<-> tells us to
interpolate the rest as if it said:

  [% title = "404 - " _ loc("File not found") %]

The C<_> is a concatenation operator. And L<Para::Frame::L10N/loc> is
the translation function.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If value starts with a '-', the rest of value will be evaluated as a TT
expression. (No expressions are normally allowed in META.)

If value starts with a '~', the rest of value will be evaluated as a
TT string with variable interpolation. It's the same as for '-' but
with the extra "" around the value.

It does not sets the variable if it's already true. That enables you
to set it in another way.

=head2 Example

  [* META otitle = '-otitle=["[_1]s administration pages", site.name]' *]

The normal use is to set the variable with the result of the template
output. But to give complex values to a variable, like a list, you can
do it as above.
